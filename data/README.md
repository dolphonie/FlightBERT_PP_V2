## Note

We are not authorized to publicly release the whole dataset used during the current study concerning
safety-critical issues. Nonetheless, the processed example samples are 
available in `example_data.txt`.

## Guidance of example data

The `example_data.txt` file contains the trajectory sequence of a flight process. Each line in the file records a sampling point, with a fixed interval of 4 seconds between each point. Each attribute within a line is delimited by the | character. The attributes are described as follows:
